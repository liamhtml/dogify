# Dogify
Dogify is a browser extension which checks all of your sites for instances of the filthy word "cat" and replaces them with "dog". Help dogify the web!
## Installation and Use
Install for your browser at its respective marketplace. Once installed, make sure the option "Replace instances of 'cat' with 'dog'" is checked. Now your browser has been Dogified! You can disable this at any time if you wish (although I don't know why you would).
## Support
Dogify is supported by most Chromium-based browsers. A lot of these browsers can download extensions from the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), so check it out!
Browsers which currently aren't supported are:
 - Mozilla Firefox (submission pending)
 - Safari (No plans for support because the apple dev license costs **99 USD *yearly***)
If your browser isn't supported, open an issue and I might add a version for it!
