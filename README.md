# Dogify
Dogify is a browser extension which checks all of your sites for instances of the filthy word "cat" and replaces them with "dog". Help dogify the web!
## Installation and Use
Install for your browser at its respective marketplace.
## Support
Dogify is supported by most Chromium-based browsers. A lot of these browsers can download extensions from the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), so check it out!
Browsers which currently aren't supported are:
 - Mozilla Firefox (COMING SOON)
 - Safari (No plans for support because the apple dev license costs **99 USD *yearly***)
If your browser isn't supported, open an issue and I might add a version for it!
