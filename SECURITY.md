## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue or vulnerability with Dogify, send an email to **dogfiyextension@gmail.com** with details on the vulnerability and how it can be reproduced. Please DO NOT open a pull request or issue here on GitHub. You will probably get a response within around a week and I will do my best to patch the issue. If I am unable to fix the issue, I will likely remove dogify from the Chrome Web Store until further notice for the good of the users.
